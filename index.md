## Introducing myself   

![myself](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juanpabmedina/juanpabmedina.github.io/main/assets/images/index/robots1.jpg)

Hi! I'm a electronics engineering student at University of Nari√±o, Colombia. Researcher assistance on swarm robotics projects in collaboration with [IRIDIA](https://code.ulb.ac.be/lab/IRIDIA) with focus on computer vision and data analysis using Open CV and Python. Experience in antenna design with HFSS, robot programming and simulation with ROS and Gazebo.

My research focuses mainly on automatic design of control software for swarm robots using image like demonstrations of the desire behaviour. Read more about my research [here](https://juanpabmedina.github.io/visualdemo-cho.html)

### SIW array antenna design

This work presents the design process of a slot array on resonant cavities in SIW (Substrate Integrated Waveguide) technology. It describes the cavity design, impedance matching, and the slot structure. Simulation results show that this array achieves high gain, low cost, minimal coupling between elements, and a radiation pattern with beamforming capabilities. These features make it suitable for commercial applications such as future WiFi wireless networks and remote sensing systems.
