Hi! I'm a electronics engineering student at University of Nari√±o, Colombia. Researcher assistance on swarm robotics projects in collaboration with [IRIDIA](https://code.ulb.ac.be/lab/IRIDIA) with focus on computer vision and data analysis using Open CV and Python. Experience in antenna design with HFSS, robot programming and simulation with ROS and Gazebo.

My research focuses mainly on automatic design of control software for swarm robots using image like demonstrations of the desire behaviour. Read more about my research [here](https://juanpabmedina.github.io/visualdemo-cho.html)
