## Introducing myself   

![myself](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juanpabmedina/juanpabmedina.github.io/main/assets/images/index/robots1.jpg)

I'm a electronics engineering student at University of Nariño, Colombia. Researcher assistance on swarm robotics projects in collaboration with [IRIDIA](https://code.ulb.ac.be/lab/IRIDIA) with focus on computer vision and data analysis using Open CV and Python. Experience in antenna design with HFSS, robot programming and simulation with ROS and Gazebo.

My research focuses mainly on automatic design of control software for swarm robots using image like demonstrations of the desire behaviour. Read more about my research [here](https://juanpabmedina.github.io/visualdemo-cho.html)

This work presents the design process of a slot array on resonant cavities in SIW (Substrate Integrated Waveguide) technology. It describes the cavity design, impedance matching, and the slot structure. Simulation results show that this array achieves high gain, low cost, minimal coupling between elements, and a radiation pattern with beamforming capabilities. These features make it suitable for commercial applications such as future WiFi wireless networks and remote sensing systems.

### Swarm Robotics
#### VisualDemo-Cho: Automatic design of swarm robot behaviors based on images demonstrations

In this work, we explore the idea that the characteristics of collective behavior in a swarm of robots can be extracted and analyzed without the need for specialized knowledge, i.e., without expert intervention. This process involves the use of visual demonstrations of swarm behavior, which are analyzed using computer vision techniques to obtain relevant features. This research introduces an automatic software design method for robot swarms called VisualDemo-Cho, which takes image-based demonstrations of the desired behavior as input to generate control software for the robot swarm. The method presented in this work is an improvement over Demo-Cho, a method previously proposed in the literature that requires expert parameterization of the features to be extracted. The results indicate that by using visual demonstrations of the desired behavior, the proposed method is able to generate control software capable of fulfilling a set of proposed missions without requiring input from an expert. Finally, the comparison of VisualDemo-Cho and Demo-Cho showed that the two methods exhibit similar performance in the generated control software.

In this research project, a mobility environment was simulated, where a drone hovers over a traffic area and captures images through a camera. The extracted images were analyzed in real-time using an object tracking and detection model, which determined the location of vehicles. The data generated in the vehicle tracking process was processed using metrics typically used for swarm robotics analysis. These metrics were translated into a real-time interface that allows graphical representations of the obtained data. This work was carried out as part of a research internship at the IRIDIA laboratory at the Université Libre de Bruxelles. The research was supervised by PhD (c) David Garzón Ramos
